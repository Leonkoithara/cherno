# Learn OpenGL
Hello I have created this repository to learn opengl. I am currently following a tutorial
given by a youtuber named Cherno however I may take a different direction in the future
in which case I will rename the repository name.

## Building
The building process is quite simple compared to the Visual Studio one since the Makefile is
all that is required. Run this command from the project root.
```
mkdir objs
mkdir bin
make
```

## Developing tips
I will probably not merge any major changes in code. One advise I'll give you is, while developing
sometimes you might have to make clean since the non-modified objs might be out of date and
might clash with the new changes.

## Additional notes
One thing to note is that I am using the GNU/Linux while following the tutorial due to which
the build systems in the tutorial and mine vary. I am using the GNU make system for building.
Which I believe looks cooler than the Visual Studio system(most important advantage).
